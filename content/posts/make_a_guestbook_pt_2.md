The website guestbook is a bygone era of the internet. Back in the 90's when the web was still in its infancy, it was common to host a guestbook on your website so that visitors could leave a comment. Even software companies like Opera (maker of the [browser](https://www.opera.com/)), had a [guestbook page](https://web.archive.org/web/19980212095842/http://www.operasoftware.com/guestbook.html).

Last year I got inspired to bring back that old part of the web and [build a guestbook](https://sunny.gg/post/make-a-guestbook) for my website. It was a feature I cobbled together in one night before posting it on Hacker News and /r/webdev and considering it done. Very quickly though users began reporting an array of bugs and poking holes in my Red Bull fueled architecture.
