Welcome to my personal website! My personal website has taken many iterations over the years and this is the latest clean sheet design (you can see my previous version [here](https://sunnygolovine.com)). This website is built with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) and uses [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for it's styling. For animations such as modals and sidebars I use [HeadlessUI](https://headlessui.com/) and for styling markdown generated pages I use [Tailwind's Typography Plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin). Behind the scenes I'm also using [next-mdx-remote]() to allow me to pass MDX anywhere on the site.

My goal with rebuilding my website was to create a site that would suit all my needs as well as be a place that can grow over the coming months and years. Previous features I carried over included: [my blog](https://sunny.gg/blog), [snippets collection](https://sunny.gg/snippets) and a [contact page](https://sunny.gg/contactme) as well as my resume (to be added in the future). In addition I also created an ["Apps Platform"](https://sunny.gg/apps) to host small web apps that wouldn't be suitable for their own project/repository.

This website is open source and the source code can be viewed on my Github Profile [here](https://github.com/sgolovine/sunny.gg).
