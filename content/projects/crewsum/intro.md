Crewsum is a suite of tools designed to help recruiters manage their team, from submitting timesheets to sending invoices and running reports. Crewsum grew out of a gap in the market, large recruiting companies will opt for tools such as ServiceNow or Oracle OpenAir but those tools are designed with a large business in mind, often leaving small independent recruiters without a good cost effective solution. Crewsum brings the benefits of solutions like ServiceNow and OpenAir to the small business owner.
